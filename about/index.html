<p>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Julia. I&rsquo;m a developer and artist living a peaceful life in a small town called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3XsEGKnwUpja3xA36">Rishikesh</a>, located in foothills of the Indian Himalayas.</p>

<p>I completed my bachelors in Computer Engineering, and after 5 years working as the Director of Technology in a Medical Education start up, I decided to take my work in the direction of my childhood passion - creating video games. I&rsquo;ve been making art my whole life and really enjoy the combination of the technical structure in game algorithms and the creativity expression &amp; freedom of art and animation in a game.</p>

<ul>
<li>Proficiency in C# and the Unity3D Library</li>
<li>Character Design</li>
<li>Level Design</li>
<li>Storywriting &amp; Game Progression</li>
<li>Sound Design &amp; Sound FX</li>

</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve solo completed 2 Game Jams (GMTK 2020 and Brackeys Jam 2020.2) working in some very unique gameplay dynamics into each game. I have a few other small games and level tests that I&rsquo;ve made - all of my projects are available to play on my <a href="https://juul1a.itch.io/">Itch</a> page. I love to take a game mechanic and figure out how it&rsquo;s best created programatically.
Here are some things I have created that I am particularly proud of&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>3D Isometric dungeon crawler mobile game</li>
<li>Endless runner mobilke game using phone gyro</li>
<li>3D Cafe SIM AI</li>
<li>2D Bullet Hell Boss shooting pattern system</li>
<li>2D Rope Physics based puzzle game</li>
<li>Underwater swimming mechanic</li>
<li>2D Platformer with flying &amp; walking enemies</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>

<p>I started sharing my entire GameDev journey on Youtube - from the very beginning of the first game I made, when I was just beginning to figure out how to use Unity. I wanted to show the entire process, as it was, to encourage other beginners like me to take joy in small successes and enjoy the journey of learning.</p>

<h3 id="game-dev-friends-club">Game Dev Friends Club</h3>

<p>In my years as a solo indie game developer, I have also gathered together a community of like-minded game developer friends, we call ourselves the Game Dev Friends Club. Together we have made a website with a community blog, and completed the 100 Days of Game Dev Challenge. It was a really fun challenge, complete with milestone bages and an active hash tag accross twitter and instagram. In our community we also held events, such as our Spooptacular Halloween game, where members of our community each made a ghost in their own art style. We put all of the ghosts together in a spooky halloween themed setting as a sort-of museum for users to walk through and explore.</p>

<h3 id="art">Art</h3>

<p>I love to incorporate my unique art style and appreciation for nature and fantasy into my work, and do my best encourages others to discover the balance between the digital &amp; natural worlds. My main style is traditional watercolour paiting which I scan into my computer and digitize for games. My digital style is still developing, however I have recently dove into the world of pixel art and really love it.</p>
